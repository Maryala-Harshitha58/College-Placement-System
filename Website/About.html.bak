develop a web portal to solve this issue. The project is aimed at developing an application for theplacement
department of the college. The system is an application which will be accessed and effectively usedthroughout the
organization with proper login enabled. It can also be used as an application for the Placement Officers in the
college to manage the student information about placement thus reducing the manual work and consumes less
paperwork. The system also provides the facility of viewing the personal and academic information of the student.
The system gets the requested list of candidates for the companies who would like to recruit the people according
